## Mnist Linear Regression

1. 2017.1.13 - Accuracy 60%
  - Try plotting objective function
  - Try plotting preprocessed data set

2. 2017.1.14 - Accuracy 90%
  - Achieve 90% of correctness
  - Batch size: 200
  - Step size: 0.0001
  - The reason why the step size is not 0.5 may be the unit size of cross-entropy function.
